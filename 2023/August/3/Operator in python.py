# Arigthmatics Operator

#  + Addition
#  - substraction
#  * Multiplication
#  / divtion
## // floar Divition (It will return quetent as  a integer after devided tow number )
# Example
x=20
y=6
z=x//y
print(z) # Output will be 6 wich is the quitent of devition



## % modulus (It will return reminder as  a integer after devided tow number )

x=20
y=6
z=x%y
print(z) # Output will be 2 wich is the quitent of devition

print(divmod(x,y))

# comperation operator
#  >,<,<=,>=,==,!=

print(x!=y)

# Assingnment operator
#   =,+=,-= etc
x+=y  # x=x+1
print(x)
